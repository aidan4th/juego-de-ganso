# Juego de Ganso

Juego de Ganso is a 2d infinte side scroller. With the objective of getting as high of a score as possible. It uses prerendered tilemaps to randomly generate selected paths for the player. Using a similar system to subway surfer and other large games in the genre. This means that Juego de Ganso is easily customizable and more levels could be added in the future. All the animations were custom made. 

## Purpose
The game was made expressly for the purpose of intergrating with kiversal medical equipment. Kiversal is a medtech company specializing in audiometery devices. Jueggo de Ganso is designed to sync with these medical devices. Kiversal is designing a medical device for all ages. Children at a very young age before having learned language can sometimes be very hard to test. Which is why an aid when administering hearing tests to young children can be necessary. This is where Juego de Ganso comes in, it is designed to be a game to help create sound triggers that can be synced with medical equipment to make it easier to test young children. Currently it can run on any computer and android device. There are no forseeable plans to add the game to iOS.
