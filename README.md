# Juego de Ganso

This game is based of the Skelton 2D demo shows how to create a rigged and animated character in 2D using
Godot's Skeleton2D node. The game was made expressly for the purpose of intergrating with kiversal medical equipment. It was designed to be an aid when administering hearing tests to young children. Currently it can run on any computer and android device. There are no forseeable plans to add the game to iOS.
